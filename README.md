# E-StarCards
This is a prototype for MMU Students where you create and study your flashcards, alongside exploring many flashcards created by other!
(Again, this is just a prototype, I haven't added that features yet. It's only you can see your own flashcards, not other!)

To use this in VScode, you need to install each file, and then combine it into a folder. Run the folder in VSCode and there you go!!
(This is my first time using github sorry xd)

Special thanks to my dad, Gemini AI, tutorials for helping me
