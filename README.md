# E-StarCards
This is a prototype for MMU Students where you create and study your flashcards, alongside exploring many flashcards created by other!
(Again, this is just a prototype, I haven't added that features yet. It's only you can see your own flashcards, not other!)

To use this in VScode, you need to:
1. Install the whole repo in a ZIP File
2. Extract the ZIP File into a folder
3. Go to VSCode and go to the top left corner and click on "File"
4. Then, click on "Open Folder" and search for the folder that you extracted
5. Lastly, select the files and run it through!!

(This is my first time using github sorry xd)
Special thanks to my dad, my friend, Gemini AI, tutorials for helping me
